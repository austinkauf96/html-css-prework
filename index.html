                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, thank you for visiting my portfolio! As you know, my name is Austin.
                I am a new student at <a style="color: black"  href="https://www.codingtemple.com" target="_blank">Coding Temple</a>
                I made the decision to pursue a career in <strong>Software Development</strong> because
                I have always had an interest in tech. In the past, I have taught myself very
                basic HTML/CSS. I found the learning experience to be challenging and rewarding.
                This new endeavor is also sparked by having my first baby on the way! I never knew
                how much 
                <strong>code</strong> was around me in everyday life. From the self-checkouts at walmart
                to my vehicles infotainment center. As I began to dive into this new strange world, this fact
                truly shocked me! As I've learned, my thought process evolved. I was very excited
                to see the things I was learning about be implemented everywhere. This truly was
                a powerful driving force! I hope to be an powerful asset in this class. Providing peer support, and just bringing a cheerful presence
                over all to any mundane day. I hope to impart knowledge, and vice versa with all of you beautiful people. 
                I can't wait to see you all on the alumni side!

                <h1>About my family</h1>
                <p>My wife and I met while I was a social media influencer, she had followed me for quite sometime. I never personally interacted with any of my "fans"
                    <strong>BUT</strong> after I had retired from influencing, I did a livestream updating people on my life. My now wife, happened to be watching. I recognized her as someone who
                    has watched before and interacted with her alot during my stream. I thought she was fun to interact with, and just was pulled to her for some odd reason. I decided to message her
                    to see if she would like to hang out. The rest was history, we havent spent more than 12 hours apart from eachother since that day. Madelyn, has a BA in Psychology with a dual minor
                    in criminology and prelaw studies. I fell inlove with her intellect, and the way she held herself. However, we were from entirely different worlds. I grew up in extreme
                    poverty, participating in things I was not proud of. She grew up in a very wealthy family, with alot of political recognition. Our differences definitely gave us combined wisdom in 
                    all aspects of life. We were together for a 6 months when we decided it would be best for us to relocate due to the rising-costs of our current housing market, and little employment prospects.
                    We moved to a little town called Macomb IL, where Maddie found employemnt utilizing her degree. We fell inlove with the change of pace. We purchased a beautiful home, and decided to build our lifes
                    here. Shortly after, we made a leap of faith and got married. 2 years later, we discovered last feb that she is pregnant with our first child. We are eager to fill the empty rooms!
                    My family truly is my motivation for this new journey in Software Development. I am excited to be able to provide!
